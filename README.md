This code is written in MATLAB, and implements the FCSS descriptor [[project website](https://seungryong.github.io/FCSS/)]. 

## Dependencies ##
  - Download [[VLFeat](http://www.vlfeat.org/)] and [[MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/)].
  - Download the datasets:
    - [[Taniai Benchmark](http://taniai.space/projects/cvpr16_dccs/)];
    - [[Proposal Flow Benchmark](http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/proposalflow/)];
    - [[Pascal-VOC Part Dataset](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tinghuiz/projects/flowWeb/)].

## Getting started ##
  - `main_FCSS_test.m` shows how to compute dense flow fields using the pretrained FCSS descriptor (`data/fcss/net-epoch.mat`) with SIFT Flow [1] and Proposal Flow [2] optimization.
  - `main_FCSS_train_Tatsunori.m`  shows how to train a new model.
  - `get_train_Tatsunori.m`: prepares the filenames of training samples.

## Main functions ##
  - `getBatch_Tatsunori.m`: prepares the images of training samples.
  - `init_FCSS.m`: builds an initial model of FCSS descriptor.
  - `CSSlayer.m`: builds convolutional self-similarity (CSS) layers using a bilinear sampler similar to spatial transformer networks (STNs) [3].
  - `CSSlayer_shift.m`: builds convolutional self-similarity (CSS) using Taylor expansion.
  - `CorrespondenceLoss.m`: builds a weakly-supervised correspondence loss for FCSS descriptor.
